# WhisperingOrchids: Nintendo Switch Custom Theme Builder

## Overview

WhisperingOrchids is a user-friendly, web-based application designed to empower Nintendo Switch users to create custom themes dynamically. It aims to overcome the limitations of existing Windows-only tools by providing an accessible and interactive platform for theme creation directly in your browser.

This tool allows you to visually design and customize various elements of your Nintendo Switch UI, including the Home Menu, Lockscreen, and other applets. You can upload custom background images, manipulate UI element positions, sizes, colors, and more, then export your creation as a `.nxtheme` file ready for use on a modded Switch console.

## Features (Version 1.0 MVP)
